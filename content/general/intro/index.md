Well now, looks like I've gone and done a thing...

I've started a blog.

There are many blogs out there that cover many of the same topics as this one... but I bet you this is the first viking themed one you've seen!

You didn't know you needed that did you? Well, maybe you didn't need it, but now you've got it. Ha!

I plan on covering many topics here, including:

- devops -- This is what I do professionally, so of course it's going to come up!
- technology
- nomad life
- off-gridding
- viking stuff -- but probably just theme items if we're being honest
- whatever else I feel like talking about

See you around!
